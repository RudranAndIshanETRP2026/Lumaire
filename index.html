    <h2>Our Story</h2>

    <p class="about-text">
      Lumaire began with a simple idea — lighting shouldn’t just illuminate a room,
      it should create a feeling.
    </p>

    <p class="about-text">
      As students and creators, we noticed how most lamps felt lifeless and generic.
      We wanted something minimal, warm, and intentional — something that transforms
      a space the moment it’s turned on.
    </p>

    <p class="about-text">
      Every Lumaire piece is designed with calm, comfort, and modern living in mind.
      This isn’t just decor. It’s atmosphere.
    </p>
